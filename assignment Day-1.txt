1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
Ans:-
    HTTP1.1 ->•	HTTP is a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server.

              •	A client sends a text-based request to a server by calling a method like GET or POST.

              •	It takes care of this problem by introducing persistent connections and pipelining. 

              •	It keeps all requests and responses in plain text format.
 
    HTTP2 ->  •	It uses the binary framing layer to encapsulate all messages in binary format.
 
              •	The binary framing layer encodes requests/responses and cuts them up into smaller packets of information.
 
              •	Multiplexes streams of data within a single TCP (transport layer) connection.
 
              •	Enables multiple concurrent responses to a client’s initial GET request.
  

2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
Ans:-
    * Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
    * Objects may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
    * The data are stored in the object in "key:value" method.The value can be accessed by using the key.
    * These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
    * A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. 
    * Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects.
